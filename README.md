# Digital-alarm-clock-using-verilog-

This project is a digital alarm clock coded in Verilog, operating in a 24-hour format. Designed to provide accurate timekeeping and reliable alarm functionality, this clock allows users to reset the clock, load the current time, set an alarm, and stop the alarm. The alarm activates precisely when the real-time matches the set alarm time.
